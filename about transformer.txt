Transformer models are a type of deep learning model that is used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They can learn long-range dependencies between words in a sentence, which makes them very powerful for tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.

Transformer models work by first encoding the input sentence into a sequence of vectors. This encoding is done using a self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to learn the relationships between the words in the sentence.

Once the input sentence has been encoded, the model decodes it into a sequence of output tokens. This decoding is also done using a self-attention mechanism.

The attention mechanism is what allows transformer models to learn long-range dependencies between words in a sentence. The attention mechanism works by focusing on the most relevant words in the input sentence when decoding the output tokens.
